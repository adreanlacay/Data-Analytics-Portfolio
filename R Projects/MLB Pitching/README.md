# MLB Pitching Analysis

Using pitching data from the 2023 MLB season, this analysis will look at the impact of a pitcher's arsenal on their effectiveness. More specifically, it will look to try and answer the following questions:
1. Does velocity and the number of pitch types play a factor in a pitcher’s success?
2. Can we use a pitcher’s speed difference from their fastball and secondary pitch to predict their whiff rate?
3. Is a pitcher’s role reliant on their pitch usage and repertoire count?
