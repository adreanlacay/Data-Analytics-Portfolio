# The Education Effect

Education has been an extremely important part of my life. For 18 years of my life, I was able to attend three levels of schooling and am still learning to this day. Of course, there were aspects of school that were not so favourable (getting up early, staying up late to finish assignments or study, peer pressure, etc.), but for the most part, I enjoyed going to my classes and having this routine. I was fortunate enough to have a life where I was able to focus on school and have it be one of my top priorities. However, this sentiment is not shared for others around the world. In some countries, school is an afterthought and not an important part of their life. This is an unfortunate mindset, but a necessary one for some individuals to live and survive.

In this analysis, we will be looking how educational attainment within countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) affects different aspects of the economy and society.

## Data

The educational attainment data was extracted from the [OECD database](https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/adult-education-level.htm) in May of 2023. It consists of 45 OECD countries and a percentage of adults (25-64 years) who's highest education levels are one of the following: Below Upper-Secondary, Upper-Secondary or Tertiary.

Population, GINI index, unemployment rates, labour force, read GDP, educational expenditure, and life expectancy data were taken from the [CIA'a World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) in February of 2023. The income per capita was also taken from the [OECD database](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/average-wages.htm) in May of 2023.
