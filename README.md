# Adrean Lacay - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Adrean and I have a degree in Statistical Sciences from the University of Toronto, where I also minored in Computer Science and History and Philosophy of Science and Technology. For the past year, I have been strengthening my analytical skills through online resources and courses. Though my learning is far from over, I hope to be able to apply my knowledge to help a team gather, organize, clean, and find useful insights in their data.

This portfolio contains projects I have worked on and are based on data or topics that pique my interest. It is meant to not only be shared and used to showcase my technical skills, but also be used as a reflection on my learning journey. So, while some projects may be considered "complete," some of them will also be updated occassionally as I continue to grow my skillset.

Whether you are reading this out of interest in me or my work, I hope you enjoy your visit!
